     *  Rules of Battleship in Java Game
     There is a 5x5 board, ie 25 blocks. There are 3 hidden ships (one in each block).
     The objective of the game is figuring out where these ships are placed and hit them.
     Every shot fired is said if you hit a ship. If you have wrong is told how many ships are in that row and that column.
     The game only ends when you find and sink the 3 ships.

     Legend pro user:
     ~: Water in the block. Still not been shot.
     *: Shot fired, there's nothing there.
     X: shot fired, there was a ship.
