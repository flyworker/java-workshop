Questions

    Consider the following class:

    public class IdentifyMyParts {
        public static int x = 7;
        public int y = 3;
    }

        What are the class variables?

        What are the instance variables?

        What is the output from the following code:

        IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
        IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
        a.y = 5;
        b.y = 6;
        a.x = 1;
        b.x = 2;
        System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);
        System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);
        System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);
        System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);
        System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);

Exercises

    Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card from a deck of cards. Playing cards have two distinguishing properties: rank and suit. Be sure to keep your solution as you will be asked to rewrite it in Enum Types.
    Hint:

    You can use the assert statement to check your assignments. You write:

    assert (boolean expression to test);

    If the boolean expression is false, you will get an error message. For example,

    assert toString(ACE) == "Ace";

    should return true, so there will be no error message.

    If you use the assert statement, you must run your program with the ea flag:

    java -ea YourProgram.class

    Write a class whose instances represent a full deck of cards. You should also keep this solution.

    3. Write a small program to test your deck and card classes. The program can be as simple as creating a deck of cards and displaying its cards.
