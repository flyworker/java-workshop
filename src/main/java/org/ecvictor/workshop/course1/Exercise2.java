/*
(Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramer’s rule to solve the following
2 * 2 system of linear equation:

		ax + by = e   x = 	ed - bf	  y = af - ec
		cx + dy = f       	ad - bc       ad - bc

Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:

					3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
					2.1x + .55y = 5.9
